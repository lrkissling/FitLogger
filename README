FitLogger

A fitness planning and tracking Android app developed by Steven Crilley
and Lowell Kissling in the Spring of 2012 as a senior project for the
EECS department of Case Western Reserve University.

Forked from the original project under Steven Crilley's old github
account (sac50) in case I ever want to screw around with it.
